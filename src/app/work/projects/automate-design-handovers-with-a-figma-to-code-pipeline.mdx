## Overview

I developed a comprehensive e-commerce mobile application using Flutter that provides a seamless shopping experience across iOS and Android platforms. The app features a modern UI, real-time product updates, and integrated payment processing.

## Key Features

- *Cross-Platform*: Single codebase for iOS and Android using Flutter
- *Product Catalog*: Dynamic product listing with search and filtering capabilities
- *Shopping Cart*: Persistent cart management with real-time updates
- *User Authentication*: Secure login/signup with Firebase Authentication
- *Payment Integration*: Stripe integration for secure payment processing
- *Responsive Design*: Adaptive UI that works on different screen sizes

## Technologies Used

- *Framework*: Flutter with Dart
- *State Management*: Provider for state management
- *Backend*: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage)
- *Payment*: Stripe SDK for Flutter
- *Architecture*: MVVM pattern with clean architecture

## Challenges and Solutions

One major challenge was implementing smooth animations and transitions while maintaining performance. I solved this by optimizing widget rebuilds using Provider and implementing custom animations. Another challenge was handling different screen sizes - I addressed this by creating responsive layouts using MediaQuery and Flexible widgets.

## Outcome

The application:
- Delivers native-like performance on both iOS and Android
- Provides intuitive user experience with smooth animations
- Successfully handles complex state management for shopping cart
- Integrates seamlessly with payment processing

This project demonstrates my expertise in Flutter development, state management, and creating production-ready mobile applications with modern UI/UX practices.
