## Overview

I developed **Task Manager**, a comprehensive Flutter mobile application designed to enhance productivity through intuitive task management, team collaboration, and offline functionality. The app provides a seamless experience for organizing personal and team tasks with real-time synchronization.

## Key Features

- *Task Management*: Create, edit, and organize tasks with categories and priorities
- *Offline Support*: Full functionality works without internet connection
- *Team Collaboration*: Share tasks and projects with team members
- *Real-time Sync*: Automatic synchronization when connection is restored
- *Customizable UI*: Dark/light themes with personalized dashboard
- *Notifications*: Smart reminders and deadline alerts
- *Data Export*: Export tasks to various formats (PDF, CSV)

## Technologies Used

- *Framework*: Flutter with Dart
- *State Management*: Bloc pattern for complex state handling
- *Local Storage*: SQLite with sqflite for offline data persistence
- *Backend*: Firebase Firestore for cloud synchronization
- *Architecture*: Clean Architecture with Repository pattern
- *UI/UX*: Material Design 3 with custom theming

## Challenges and Solutions

The biggest challenge was implementing robust offline functionality while maintaining data consistency. I solved this by creating a sophisticated sync mechanism using SQLite for local storage and implementing conflict resolution strategies. Another challenge was managing complex state across multiple screens - I addressed this by implementing the Bloc pattern with proper event handling and state management.

## Outcome

The application:
- Provides seamless offline experience with automatic sync
- Delivers intuitive user interface with smooth animations
- Successfully handles team collaboration features
- Maintains data integrity across multiple devices

This project demonstrates my expertise in Flutter development, offline-first architecture, and creating scalable mobile applications with complex state management requirements.
