## Overview

I developed a comprehensive fitness tracking mobile application using Flutter that helps users monitor their health, track workouts, and achieve fitness goals. The app features workout logging, progress tracking, health monitoring, and personalized fitness recommendations.

## Key Features

- *Workout Logging*: Track various exercises with sets, reps, and weights
- *Progress Tracking*: Visual charts and graphs showing fitness progress over time
- *Health Monitoring*: Integration with health sensors for heart rate and step counting
- *Custom Workouts*: Create and save personalized workout routines
- *Goal Setting*: Set and track fitness goals with milestone celebrations
- *Social Features*: Share achievements and compete with friends
- *Offline Support*: Full functionality works without internet connection

## Technologies Used

- *Framework*: Flutter with Dart
- *State Management*: Riverpod for reactive state management
- *Local Database*: SQLite with sqflite for data persistence
- *Health Integration*: Health Connect (Android) and HealthKit (iOS)
- *Charts*: FL Chart for data visualization
- *Animations*: Custom animations for workout tracking
- *Architecture*: Clean Architecture with Repository pattern

## Challenges and Solutions

The main challenge was integrating with different health platforms across iOS and Android while maintaining a consistent user experience. I solved this by creating platform-specific implementations and using Flutter's platform channels. Another challenge was handling large amounts of fitness data efficiently - I addressed this by implementing proper database indexing and pagination.

## Outcome

The application:
- Provides comprehensive fitness tracking with intuitive UI
- Successfully integrates with device health sensors
- Delivers smooth performance with large datasets
- Offers personalized fitness insights and recommendations

This project demonstrates my expertise in Flutter development, health app integration, and creating data-driven mobile applications with complex state management and visualization requirements.
