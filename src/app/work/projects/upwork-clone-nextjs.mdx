## Overview

I developed a comprehensive social media mobile application using Flutter that enables users to connect, share content, and interact in real-time. The app features modern UI design, real-time messaging, photo sharing, and social interaction features similar to popular social platforms.

## Key Features

- *User Authentication*: Secure login/signup with Firebase Authentication
- *Real-time Messaging*: Instant messaging with Firebase Firestore
- *Photo Sharing*: Upload and share photos with Firebase Storage
- *Social Feed*: Dynamic feed with posts, likes, and comments
- *User Profiles*: Customizable user profiles with bio and photos
- *Push Notifications*: Real-time notifications for interactions
- *Cross-Platform*: Works seamlessly on both iOS and Android

## Technologies Used

- *Framework*: Flutter with Dart
- *State Management*: Bloc pattern for complex state handling
- *Backend*: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage, Cloud Messaging)
- *Real-time Database*: Firebase Firestore for live updates
- *Image Handling*: Image picker and caching
- *Push Notifications*: Firebase Cloud Messaging
- *UI/UX*: Custom widgets with Material Design principles

## Challenges and Solutions

The biggest challenge was implementing real-time features while maintaining app performance. I solved this by optimizing Firestore queries, implementing proper pagination, and using efficient state management with Bloc. Another challenge was handling image uploads and storage - I addressed this by implementing proper image compression and using Firebase Storage with progress tracking.

## Outcome

The application:
- Provides smooth real-time messaging experience
- Delivers fast photo sharing with optimized uploads
- Successfully handles complex social interactions
- Maintains excellent performance across different devices

This project demonstrates my expertise in Flutter development, real-time database integration, and creating scalable social media applications with modern UI/UX practices.
