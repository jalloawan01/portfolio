## Overview

Nexus Store is a professionally engineered e-commerce platform developed using Flutter and Supabase, designed to deliver a premium customer shopping experience alongside a secure and efficient administrative management system. The project consists of two tightly integrated applications: a Customer Mobile Application focused on usability, performance, and premium UI/UX, and an Admin Management Application focused on inventory control, category management, and operational monitoring.

Both applications share a unified backend architecture, ensuring real-time data synchronization, consistency, and secure role-based access.

## System Architecture

- **Frontend**: Flutter (Material 3)
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Authentication, Row Level Security)
- **Architecture Style**: Modular, scalable, and role-based
- **Data Flow**: Single source of truth with real-time sync between admin and customer applications

## Customer Application Features

The Nexus Store Customer App is a premium e-commerce mobile application designed for a seamless sneaker shopping experience. The application prioritizes clean aesthetics, responsiveness, and persistent user interaction while maintaining real-time connectivity with the cloud backend.

### Core Features

- **Premium UI/UX Design**: Custom design system with Google Fonts (Poppins) to deliver a refined, luxury feel
- **Real-Time Product Catalog**: Live inventory fetched directly from Supabase, ensuring up-to-date product listings
- **Hybrid Cart Management System**: 
  - Local persistence using SharedPreferences for instant UI responsiveness
  - Cloud synchronization via Supabase to preserve cart data across sessions and logins
- **Smart Search & Filtering**: Real-time search and filtering for efficient product discovery
- **Theme Engine**: Support for both Light Mode and a deep, luxury-inspired Dark Mode

### Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Flutter (Material 3)
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL & Authentication)
- **State Management**: Provider (Cart, Favorites, Theme)
- **Typography**: Google Fonts (Poppins)

## Admin Management Application Features

The Nexus Store Admin App is a role-restricted Flutter application designed to manage and monitor the e-commerce platform. It serves as the operational backbone of the system, allowing administrators to maintain inventory, categories, and orders with full data integrity.

### Core Features

- **Secure Admin Authentication**: Restricted access with no public registration, ensuring controlled system management
- **Product Management (CRUD)**: Create, update, and delete products including images, pricing, and category assignment
- **Category Management**: Structured organization of products for efficient catalog management
- **Real-Time Synchronization**: Immediate data reflection across admin and customer applications
- **Dashboard & Order Monitoring**: Real-time visibility into inventory status and customer orders

### Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Flutter (Material 3)
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL & Authentication)
- **State Management**: Provider (Products, Categories, Admin Actions)
- **Image Handling**: Secure network-based image storage

## Security & Access Control

- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Ensures users can only access records associated with their user_id
- **Admin-Only Operations**: No admin or privileged operations are exposed within the customer application
- **Role-Based Access**: Authentication and access control are fully managed via Supabase
- **Data Isolation**: Customer-sensitive data remains isolated and protected

## Database Architecture

### Customer Application
- **products**: Read-only product catalog
- **cart_items**: User-specific cart persistence
- **orders**: Order records (extendable for real-world deployment)

### Admin Application
- **products**: Full CRUD operations
- **categories**: Product grouping and classification
- **orders**: Read-only order monitoring

## Challenges and Solutions

The biggest challenge was implementing a hybrid cart system that provides instant UI responsiveness while maintaining cloud synchronization. I solved this by using SharedPreferences for local persistence and implementing smart sync logic that updates Supabase in the background. Another challenge was ensuring real-time data consistency between admin and customer applications - I addressed this by leveraging Supabase's real-time subscriptions and implementing proper Row Level Security policies.

## Outcome

The Nexus Store platform:
- Delivers a premium shopping experience with luxury-inspired UI/UX
- Provides seamless real-time synchronization between admin and customer applications
- Maintains excellent performance with hybrid cart management
- Ensures secure, role-based access control throughout the system
- Supports scalable operations with modular architecture

This project demonstrates my expertise in Flutter development, full-stack architecture design, real-time database integration, and creating production-ready e-commerce solutions with comprehensive security measures and scalable infrastructure.
